# text2brainfuck #

This python script takes user input and turn it into brainfuck readable data (in the most memory-wise method, using only a single memory slot).
<br><br>

### Syntax: ###
```python
python3 converter.py myText
```

One can also choose to provide no parameter, executing only
```python
python3 converter.py
```
if that heppens, the script will ask for user input, using the `input()` built-in function.
